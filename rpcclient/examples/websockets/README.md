Websockets Example
=======================

This example shows how to use the rpcclient package to connect to an RPC
server using TLS-secured websockets, register for block connected and block
disconnected notifications, and get the current block count.

This example also sets a timer to shutdown the client after 10 seconds to
demonstrate clean shutdown.

Modify the `main.go` source to specify the correct RPC username and
password for the RPC server:

```Go
	User: "yourrpcuser",
	Pass: "yourrpcpass",
```

Finally, navigate to the example's directory and run it with:

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kaspanet/kaspad/rpcclient/examples/websockets
$ go run *.go
```
